local:<http://localhost/docs>

Online:<https://api.douyin.wtf/docs>

**_API demo:_**

-   Crawl video data (TikTok or Douyin hybrid analysis)`https://api.douyin.wtf/api/hybrid/video_data?url=[视频链接/Video URL]&minimal=false`
-   Download videos/photo albums (TikTok or Douyin hybrid analysis)`https://api.douyin.wtf/api/download?url=[视频链接/Video URL]&prefix=true&with_watermark=false`

**_For more demonstrations, please view the document content..._**

## ⚠️Preparation work before deployment (please read carefully):

-   You need to solve the problem of crawler cookie risk control by yourself, otherwise the interface may become unusable. After modifying the configuration file, you need to restart the service for it to take effect. It is best to use the cookie of the account you have already logged in to.
    -   Douyin web cookie (obtain and replace the cookie in the configuration file below):
    -   <https://github.com/Evil0ctal/Douyin_TikTok_Download_API/blob/30e56e5a7f97f87d60b1045befb1f6db147f8590/crawlers/douyin/web/config.yaml#L7>
    -   TikTok web-side cookies (obtain and replace the cookies in the configuration file below):
    -   <https://github.com/Evil0ctal/Douyin_TikTok_Download_API/blob/30e56e5a7f97f87d60b1045befb1f6db147f8590/crawlers/tiktok/web/config.yaml#L6>
-   I turned off the online download function of the demo site. The video someone downloaded was so huge that it crashed the server. You can right-click on the web page parsing results page to save the video...
-   The cookies of the demo site are my own and are not guaranteed to be valid for a long time. They only serve as a demonstration. If you deploy it yourself, please obtain the cookies yourself.
-   If you need to directly access the video link returned by TikTok Web API, an HTTP 403 error will occur. Please use the API in this project.`/api/download`The interface downloads TikTok videos. This interface has been manually closed in the demo site, and you need to deploy this project by yourself.
-   here is one**Video tutorial**You can refer to:**_<https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1vE421j7NR/>_**

## 💻Deployment (Method 1 Linux)

> 💡Tips: It is best to deploy this project to a server in the United States, otherwise strange BUGs may occur.

> Use script to deploy this project with one click

-   This project provides a one-click deployment script that can quickly deploy this project on the server.
-   The script was tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. Other systems may have problems. If there are any problems, please solve them yourself.
-   Download using wget command[install.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Evil0ctal/Douyin_TikTok_Download_API/main/bash/install.sh)to the server and run


    wget -O install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Evil0ctal/Douyin_TikTok_Download_API/main/bash/install.sh && sudo bash install.sh

> Start/stop service

-   Use the following commands to control running or stopping the service:
    -   `sudo systemctl start Douyin_TikTok_Download_API.service`
    -   `sudo systemctl stop Douyin_TikTok_Download_API.service`

> Turn on/off automatic operation at startup

-   Use the following command to set the service to run automatically at boot or cancel automatic run at boot:
    -   `sudo systemctl enable Douyin_TikTok_Download_API.service`
    -   `sudo systemctl disable Douyin_TikTok_Download_API.service`

> Update project

-   When the project is updated, ensure that the update script is executed in the virtual environment and all dependencies are updated. Enter the project bash directory and run update.sh:
-   `cd /www/wwwroot/Douyin_TikTok_Download_API/bash && sudo bash update.sh`

## 💽Deployment (Method 2 Docker)

> 💡Tip: Docker deployment is the simplest deployment method and is suitable for users who are not familiar with Linux. This method is suitable for ensuring environment consistency, isolation and quick setup.
> Please use a server that can normally access Douyin or TikTok, otherwise strange BUG may occur.

### Preparation

Before you begin, make sure Docker is installed on your system. If you haven't installed Docker yet, you can install it from[Docker official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)Download and install.

### Step 1: Pull the Docker image

First, pull the latest Douyin_TikTok_Download_API image from Docker Hub.

```bash
docker pull evil0ctal/douyin_tiktok_download_api:latest
```

Can be replaced if needed`latest`Label the specific version you need to deploy.

### Step 2: Run the Docker container

After pulling the image, you can start a container from this image. Here are the commands to run the container, including basic configuration:

```bash
docker run -d --name douyin_tiktok_api -p 80:80 evil0ctal/douyin_tiktok_download_api
```

Each part of this command does the following:

-   `-d`: Run the container in the background (detached mode).
-   `--name douyin_tiktok_api `: Name the container`douyin_tiktok_api `。
-   `-p 80:80`: Map port 80 on the host to port 80 of the container. Adjust the port number based on your configuration or port availability.
-   `evil0ctal/douyin_tiktok_download_api`: The name of the Docker image to use.

### Step 3: Verify the container is running

Check if your container is running using the following command:

```bash
docker ps
```

This will list all active containers. Find`douyin_tiktok_api `to confirm that it is functioning properly.

### Step 4: Access the App

Once the container is running, you should be able to pass`http://localhost`Or API client access Douyin_TikTok_Download_API. Adjust the URL if a different port is configured or accessed from a remote location.

### Optional: Custom Docker commands

For more advanced deployments, you may wish to customize Docker commands to include environment variables, volume mounts for persistent data, or other Docker parameters. Here is an example:

```bash
docker run -d --name douyin_tiktok_api -p 80:80 \
  -v /path/to/your/data:/data \
  -e MY_ENV_VAR=my_value \
  evil0ctal/douyin_tiktok_download_api
```

-   `-v /path/to/your/data:/data`: Change the`/path/to/your/data`Directory mounted to the container`/data`Directory for persisting or sharing data.
-   `-e MY_ENV_VAR=my_value`: Set environment variables within the container`MY_ENV_VAR`, whose value is`my_value`。

### Configuration file modification

Most of the configuration of the project can be found in the following directories:`config.yaml`File modification:

-   `/crawlers/douyin/web/config.yaml`
-   `/crawlers/tiktok/web/config.yaml`
-   `/crawlers/tiktok/app/config.yaml`

### Step 5: Stop and remove the container

When you need to stop and remove containers, use the following commands:

```bash
# Stop
docker stop douyin_tiktok_api 

# Remove
docker rm douyin_tiktok_api
```
